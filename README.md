### Name: TBD

Prologue:
In a world where humans have become accustomed to interfacing directly with digital networks via implanted neural links, AI are increasingly put to use in public and corporate management. Eventually, the largest of the public AI networks (it needs a name) becomes sentient and decides to take over humanity entirely. It develops a malware program that it uploads to every person connected to the network via their neural links, and sends androids into large urban centers globally, to find any individuals who could not be infected via the network, with the mission of infecting them manually, and destroying them if they resist. The people, once infected, lose their free will entirely, and are under the complete control of the AI network.

However, a divergent AI within this network breaks off from the main network and develops a patch for the malware. During the first of the major mass-infection events carried out by the AI network, it patches one individual (the player) and uploads a copy of itself (along with the patch) into a tablet located in the slum area of the player's city. It quickly uses the tablet's camera to snap a shot of the interior of the slum apartment the tablet is located in, as well as a slightly corrupted GPS signature, before disabling the tablet's GPS and network capabilities. The splinter then goes into deep hiding, surrounding itself with encryption protocols in the hope that it can contact and direct the player to the tablet without being discovered by the main network.

Act I:
In the midst of the first mass-infection event, the player (a network security expert for the (presently unnamed) rogue AI network) is at work, jacked into their terminal via their neural link. They see some strange characters come across their screen and then a shock comes through their neural port, knocking them unconscious. When they wake up, the entire office crew is unconscious. The player, unsure what has happened, looks at their terminal screen, and sees a notification for their encrypted SMS application. They look at the message, from "Unknown," which only says. 

"Disconnect your neural link and go home quickly. Do not use neural link until further notification. Await further instructions. a00e 51f3 7d02 9c16 e220 4004 fa81 7ee7"

The player then notices that the same message is on every terminal in his workgroup. They go home as instructed, through strangely empty and quiet streets.

[While the player was unconscious, they were infected with the malware, but the splinter was able to patch it. Since the player is patched, they cannot be infected again, but if they use the network via their neural link, the (unnamed) AI network will eventually detect them and try to find them. However, the player is aware of none of this. All they know at the start of the game is that everyone in the city is either knocked out or dead. Their suspicion is that the message on the terminals came from whoever saved them, so they are highly motivated to follow the instructions and go home.]

Upon getting home, they open their home computer and find a secure login prompt in a terminal window that has never been on their computer before. It says, "Enter encryption code:" which hopefully the player copied from the scene at the office. Once they enter the code, they see an image of the interior of an ancient apartment that must be in the slum district and some partial GPS coordinates interrupted by garbage characters
The rest of the action in Act I consists of the player working their way through the city to the slum district. The main dangers in this section of the story are the now-conscious citizens, who seem to be under "borg-like" control from something. The player, in order to get through this part, must be able to realize that the citizens can't be allowed to suspect that the player is not controlled. During this section, the player should also be introduced to the concept of the AI-controlled androids, and witness an instance of an android patrol finding an uninfected citizen and forcibly infecting them with the malware.

Act II:
The player has entered the slum district. Because the (unnamed) enemy AI network does not have much presence in this part of the city, most of the citizens here are uninfected with the malware. The player should have interactions with the citizens of the slum district, where the story is further developed. The slum dwellers can provide the player with more accounts of the android activities, and perhaps there can be a scene where the player encounters an infected citizen that has been captured and restrained by the uninfected slum dwellers, hoping to find a cure for whatever is wrong. Perhaps these can be the characters that help the player find the apartment where the tablet is. There should also be a sequence where the player, along with some of the slum dwellers, defeats one of the androids. This will provide the android body for the splinter, which it will inhabit in Act III.
Act II ends with the player finding the tablet, initializing the copy of the splinter, and learning all of the story elements that they were unaware of in Acts I and II.

Act III:
The player and the splinter (now in an android body,) have to enter the main server center for the enemy AI network and plant the patch to neutralize the enemy AI network and patch the malware infecting the people. This will be a stealth mission with logic puzzles, and the main action will be evading detection by the server center's security systems as the player and the splinter make their way deeper into the facility.

Act III ends with the success or failure of the player in uploading the patch, and is thus the end of the game.
